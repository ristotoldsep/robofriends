React app that pulls from robohash API for displaying robots with components like Cards and a Searchbox for displaying specific robots.

Later on tried React Hooks, and replaced component and class with hooks (useState & useEffect). [OLDER VERSION IS DEPLOYED]

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
